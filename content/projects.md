This is a selection of some of the projects I worked on over the years.

All the projects in this page hold special significance to me, for one reason or the other.

# Elemento 265 (????)

Commissioned by artist Paolo Grassi, *Elemento 265* is the largest outdoor art installation in the Ticino region of Switzerland.
I took this project from an rough sketch all the way to it's fabrication and installation.
The size of some of the component exceeded the limits of the machines used to produce them, and so some ingenuity was required to bring it to completion

# Mountain Bike Shock Telemetry (2020)

A sensor installed on the bike shock absorbers feeds real-time data to an Android application via Bluetooth. The sensor facilitates the bike setup.
This is an ongoing passion project and I'm experimenting with other sensors as well as allowing recording and replay of the data stream for later analysis.

# Floating Staircase (2021)

A one-of-a kind stair that floats in place as needed.

# Waves, Piazza Canobbio (????)

A decorative fence commissioned for the main square of the town of Canobbio.
The city engineers wanted a theme of waves, reminder of the lake upon which the square faces.
But other than a theme, the architect left design and fabrication up to me.

# High-efficiency compost processor (????)

An industrial composting tumbler that turns leftover food into soil good enough to be sold by the bag as potting mix.
This project required understanding of the underlying chemical processes, which was fun to learn.
This is the first machine I designed, produced and sold.

# Raiffeisen Bank Elevator Control (????)
A system to dispatch and recall elevators from the lobby desk.
The control panel seamlessly blends into the curved glass of the welcome desk.
This project was fun because it blended elements of engineering and safety with elements of aesthetics and design.

# Hiking and Biking Paths Restoration in ? (????)
Over the course of a summer, with the help of some friends, we restored numerous trails and path that were unmaintained and almost disappeared.
We modified some of them to make more fun and challenging for downhill mountain biking.
To this date, the paths are very popular and regularly used by many bikers and hikers.

# Gold Ore Sieve (????)

An industrial sieving machine that, to date, separates most of the gold mined in Switzerland.
This new machine retired the previous model, in use since the 70s, drastically improving on efficiency.

# Sloth (2021 and beyond)

Sloth is an RC Crawler with a novel suspension system, wheels and body I designed entirely from scratch. It is unlike any other competition Crawler. Furthermore its design is dynamic and adaptable, it can be reconfigured based on the type of terrain and conditions.
Pitting my own car against expert pilots with expensive vehicles is a lot of fun.

# Bike Garage (????)

I like to help friends setup, tune and repair their bikes.
Not a day goes by without someone popping in for a quick adjustment.
